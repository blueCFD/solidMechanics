Application
    elasticThermalSolidFoam

Description
    Transient/steady-state segregated finite-volume solver for small strain
    elastic thermal solid bodies. Temperature is solved and then coupled
    displacement is solved.

    Displacement field U is solved for using a total Lagrangian approach,
    also generating the strain tensor field epsilon and stress tensor
    field sigma and temperature field T.
